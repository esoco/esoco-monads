This project contains a small library that defines generic Java interfaces for functors and monads as well as implementations of several standard Monads. It has a single dependency to the [esoco-common project](https://esoco.github.io/esoco-common/), also a small library which provides some standard functionality.

An introduction and further information can be found on the [project page](https://esoco.github.io/esoco-monads/).
