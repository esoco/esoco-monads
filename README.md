# The esoco-monads project

[![](https://github.com/esoco/esoco-monads/workflows/Build/badge.svg)](https://github.com/esoco/esoco-monads/actions)

This project contains a library that defines generic Java interfaces for
functors and monads as well as implementations of several standard Monads. It
has a single dependency to
the [esoco-common project](https://esoco.github.io/esoco-common/), also a small
library which provides some standard functionality.

An introduction and further information can be found on
the [project page](https://esoco.github.io/esoco-monads/).
